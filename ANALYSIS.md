# Analysis and Conclusions

1. The distribution of male vs female mice was 51.0% vs 49% respectively.
2. Capomulin and Ramicane, having the lowest final tumor volumes appear to be the most effective cancer treatments out of those tested
3. Based on data for mouse ID x401 - show that Capomulin has promising results, with Mouse x401's tumor volume decreasing from 45.47 mm3 to 28.48 mm3 over the 45 day trial period. The plot does show, however, that at timepoints 5, 15, 30 and 45 mouse x401's tumor size was larger than at the previous timepoint. Further plotting (see 'bonus graph') shows that tumor size of serveral mice (i557, r157) treated with Capomulin increased over time, and further testing would be required. 
4. The Pearson r correlation coefficient of 0.84 shows that there is a strong correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight - where 'strong' is defined as values of r > 0.7.
